Open Source Intelligence (OS-INT) is defined as the act of extracting and analysing information from publicly accessible sources. Its purposes include, but are not limited to national security, military intrigue, business intelligence and academic research. With the rapid growth of the reach of the internet, OS-INT has reached new highs in levels of practitioners, as well as the breadth of the content illustrated by the data. 



For this project, we are working with several different sources of data, and OS-INT practitioners, such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), who provide data which encapsulates military expenditure, armed conflict and the arms trade.


It is without doubt that the collective reliance and funding of the military industrial complex has shown massive benefits and disadvantages for individuals across the world, with corporations raking in giant profits, and conflict decimating communities worldwide. With this project, we hope to clearly visualise the direct correlation between the transfer of arms and equipment to the levels of conflict across the globe.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Before running this, please replace `/node_modules/react-scripts\config\webpack.config.js` with the one found in the root directory

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
